                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Welcome to my comic store!</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I've been collecting comics since I was about 10 years old, driven
                        by a love for characters like
                        <strong>Green Lantern</strong>. Over the years, my collection grew as I carefully bought,
                        bagged, and preserved each issue, originally hoping to pass them on to my kids. While they
                        didn't catch the comic bug, I've decided to use my collection to kickstart a new adventure—my
                        own comic book business.
                     </p>

                        range of carefully stored comics, each with a story to tell, and all ready for a new home.
                        Whether you're a die-hard fan or a new collector, I'm here to help you find the perfect addition
                        to your collection!

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Shipping Policy</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We are committed to providing you with the best possible shipping
                        experience, ensuring your
                        items arrive safely, securely, and as quickly as possible. Our shipping policy has been
                        developed to clearly inform you about our processes, timelines, and options available to best
                        meet your needs.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Processing Time:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">All orders are processed within 1-2 business days after payment is
                        confirmed. Business days are
                        considered Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and public holidays. We strive to get your
                        orders out promptly, but please allow for extra processing time during peak periods or holiday
                        seasons. You will receive a notification once your item has shipped.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Shipping Carriers and Options:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We work with a variety of trusted carriers, such as USPS, UPS,
                        FedEx, and DHL, to ensure
                        reliable delivery. The shipping options available to you may vary depending on your location.
                        Domestic shipments are usually completed through standard carriers like USPS Priority Mail or
                        First Class, depending on the size and value of the package. We also offer expedited shipping
                        for those who need their items sooner.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Domestic vs. International Shipping:</h5>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Domestic Shipping:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">For orders within the United States, estimated delivery times vary
                        depending on the carrier and
                        the selected shipping method. Typically, standard shipping takes 3-5 business days, while
                        expedited shipping takes 1-3 business days.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">International Shipping:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We also ship internationally and aim to provide reasonable delivery
                        options for our global
                        customers. Depending on your location, shipping times for international orders may range between
                        7-21 business days. We do our best to facilitate customs clearance, but please note that all
                        import duties, taxes, or other charges are the responsibility of the buyer. We recommend
                        contacting your local customs office for any questions about additional fees.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Tracking Information:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">All shipments include tracking details, which will be provided to
                        you once your item has been
                        dispatched. You will be able to monitor the status of your shipment using the tracking number
                        provided in your order confirmation email. Please note that for some international orders, full
                        tracking may not be available once the package leaves the United States.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Packaging:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We take great care in packing your items to ensure they arrive in
                        excellent condition.
                        Collectibles such as comics are carefully packaged with protective materials like bubble wrap,
                        rigid mailers, and cardboard supports to avoid any damage during transit. We understand the
                        value and fragility of collectibles and want you to receive them in the condition they were
                        listed.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Shipping Rates:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Shipping rates are calculated based on the weight, dimensions, and
                        destination of your order.
                        You can view the shipping costs for your item in your shopping cart before finalizing your
                        order. We occasionally offer free shipping on select items or during promotional periods, so be
                        sure to check for any current offers.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Combined Shipping:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">If you are purchasing multiple items from our store, we are happy
                        to provide combined shipping
                        to reduce costs where possible. Please reach out to us before completing your purchase so that
                        we can adjust the shipping fees accordingly. Our goal is to make shipping as affordable and
                        convenient as possible for our customers.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Lost, Damaged, or Delayed Shipments:</h5>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Lost Shipments:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">If your shipment has not arrived within the expected timeframe,
                        please reach out to us so we can
                        investigate the matter with the carrier. Lost package claims may require a waiting period, as
                        carriers need time to verify and investigate the shipment status.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Damaged Shipments:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">If an item arrives damaged, please contact us immediately. We will
                        work with you to either
                        replace the item or provide a suitable solution. Please be prepared to share photos of the
                        damaged packaging and product for us to initiate a claim with the carrier.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Delayed Shipments:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Delays can occur, particularly during peak shipping seasons.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Returns Policy</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We understand that sometimes a purchase may not meet your
                        expectations, and we want to make the
                        return process as straightforward as possible. Please read our return policy carefully to ensure
                        a smooth and satisfactory return experience.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Eligibility for Returns:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We offer a 30-day return policy for most items, starting from the
                        day you receive your package.
                        Items must be returned in the same condition in which they were received, including any original
                        packaging and accessories. The item must be in unused and undamaged condition. Please note that
                        certain items may be non-returnable, including items sold in "as-is" condition, limited-edition
                        collectibles, or personalized items.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Condition Requirements:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The condition of the item is very important for returns, especially
                        for collectibles like comic
                        books. All comics must be returned in their original packaging (e.g., protective bags and
                        boards) and without any damage. Items showing signs of wear, use, or tampering may not qualify
                        for a full refund or may be subject to a restocking fee.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Return Process:</h5>
                     <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        <li>To initiate a return, please contact us through eBay messages to request a return
                           authorization. This helps us keep track of the process and ensures a faster resolution.</li>
                        <li>Once your return request is approved, we will provide you with instructions for returning
                           the item. We may issue you a return shipping label, or you may be responsible for return
                           shipping costs based on the reason for the return.</li>
                        <li>After we receive and inspect the returned item, we will process your refund or exchange
                           within 5-7 business days. Refunds will be credited to the original payment method used for
                           the purchase. Please note that depending on your bank, it may take additional time for the
                           refund to reflect on your statement.</li>
                     </ul>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Return Shipping:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The cost of return shipping will generally be the responsibility of
                        the buyer, except in cases
                        where we are at fault (e.g., incorrect item shipped, item damaged during shipping). We recommend
                        using a tracked and insured shipping method when returning items to protect yourself in the
                        event of loss or damage during transit.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Restocking Fee:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In some instances, a restocking fee of up to 20% may be applied to
                        returns, particularly if
                        items are not returned in their original condition or if items are missing original packaging or
                        accessories. The restocking fee is intended to cover costs associated with repackaging,
                        inspection, and re-listing.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Non-Returnable Items:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Certain items may not be eligible for returns. These include:</p>
                     <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        <li>Items listed as "as-is" or "final sale."</li>
                        <li>Personalized or custom-made items.</li>
                        <li>Limited-edition or rare collectibles that are explicitly listed as non-returnable.</li>
                     </ul>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Return for Exchange:</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In the event that you wish to exchange an item (e.g., for a
                        different issue or variant of a
                        comic), please contact us to discuss the availability of the item you are interested in.
                        Exchanges are subject to availability, and additional shipping charges may apply.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Warranty Policy</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our goal is to ensure that you are satisfied with your purchase and
                        confident in its
                        authenticity and quality. Our warranty policy has been designed to address common questions
                        related to the quality, authenticity, and longevity of the products we sell.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Items Sold "As-Is"</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Many of the items in our store are sold "as-is," which means they
                        do not come with a warranty or
                        guarantee of any kind beyond the information provided in the listing. This is particularly
                        relevant for collectible comics, where condition, age, and wear may vary. We strive to describe
                        each item accurately and provide detailed images so you can make an informed purchase.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Quality and Authenticity Assurance</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">While we do not offer a traditional warranty, we stand by the
                        authenticity and quality of our
                        products. We take every measure to ensure that each comic book, collectible, or item is genuine

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Condition Grading</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">To help provide transparency, we grade the condition of all
                        collectible comics using standard
                        industry terms such as <strong>Near Mint (NM), Very Fine (VF), Fine (FN)</strong>, etc. If you
                        receive an item that you feel was inaccurately graded or not as described, please let us know.
                        We are open to addressing discrepancies, as we understand how important condition is to comic
                        collectors.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Claims for Defective or Incorrect Items</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">If you receive an incorrect or defective item, please contact us
                        within <strong>7 days</strong>
                        of receiving the shipment. We will work with you to either replace the item or provide an
                        appropriate solution. Please note that defective items include any shipping-related damage or
                        issues that make the product unusable or significantly diminish its value.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Third-Party Graded Items</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Some of our comics are professionally graded by third-party
                        companies such as
                        <strong>CGC</strong> or <strong>CBCS</strong>. In such cases, the comic book is sealed and
                        certified with a specific grade that guarantees the condition. Any warranties or claims
                        regarding the grading of these items should be directed to the grading company.

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Use of Personal Information</h5>

                        do not share your data with third parties except in instances where it is required to fulfill
                        your order (e.g., sharing your address with the shipping carrier) or process payments securely
                        (e.g., through eBay's payment platform). Your contact details may also be used to send you
                        updates about your order, such as shipping notifications or other necessary information.</p>

                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our store, like many e-commerce websites, may use cookies and
                        similar tracking technologies to

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Third-Party Services</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our store may utilize third-party services (e.g., shipping
                        carriers, payment processors) to
                        fulfill orders and provide additional services. These third parties have their own privacy
                        policies that govern the handling of your personal data. We take care to partner with reputable
                        companies that are committed to data privacy.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Your Rights</h5>

                        information we have collected from
                        you. If you have questions regarding the data we store or wish to make changes, please contact

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Retention Period</h5>
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Personal information is retained for as long as necessary to
                        fulfill the purposes outlined in
                        this policy. For example, we retain your shipping information for order fulfillment and customer
                        service purposes, but we do not store payment information beyond what is necessary to process
                        transactions.</p>

                     <h5 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h5>
